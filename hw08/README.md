## HOMEWORK 8: MORE PRACTICE WITH LOOPS
> * Due date: Midnight on Wednesday, 10/25 (1 week)
> * Part I: Setting up your new homework branch
> * Part II: Coding Homework
> * Part III: Submit

## Part I: GitHub Setup
1. Using the Terminal, navigate to your mmart-168-fall2017 git repository: `$ cd {your git repository path} #different for everyone`
2. Check out the master branch: `$ git checkout master`
3. Pull the most recent changes from the upstream repository: `$ git pull --rebase upstream master`
4. Create a new branch to do Homework 8: `$ git branch homework08`
5. Checkout your new homework08 branch: `$ git checkout homework08`
6. Verify that you are now on the new branch: `$ git branch` (check that your new homework08 branch has an asterisk next to it).

## Part II: Coding
### A. While Loops
Using a while loop, print a message (any message you want) 100 times

### B. Writing to the DOM, using a Loop
Using a for loop, write out each personâ€™s avatar, name, and score, based on the **people** array


## Part III: Submit
1. Just as in Part II, open your Terminal and type: `$ git status`. It should tell you which files you've changed.
2. To "commit" all of your changes, type: ` $ git commit -am 'Completed homework 8'`
3. To "push" your change to up to your github account, type: `$ git push --set-upstream origin homework08`
4. Finally, verify that your changes are up on GitHub by logging into your GitHub account and taking a look at your newly created homework08 branch.
5. **Submit your homework by pasting a link to your branch into the Moodle.**
