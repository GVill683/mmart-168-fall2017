# HW01 - Write to the DOM

## Instructions

The homework includes a simple HTML page for you to get started. DO NOT modify the HTML of the page. There are commented lines of code that indicate where you should write code. If you open index.html in your favorite browser, you should see three buttons. The buttons should do as follows:

1. The "Add hardcoded data" button should surface a `200x300` image from `http://placebear.com/`. The `Hello, world` text should change to read `I'm a bear!`

2. The "Add data from JSON" button should use the image and text in the provided `pageInfo` object.

3. The clear button should return the page to its empty state.

#### Extra credit
Devise a way to change the styling of the page (e.g., switch to sans-serif typefaces when the page is cleared, or change the color of the buttons depending on the current content)
